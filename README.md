# A-Maze-ing 🧩

This project is a maze generator and solver, built in Python using MiniLibX (MLX) for graphical rendering.

## 🚀 How to configure the project (Setup)

To ensure that the project runs in a clean environment, we use a virtual environment (`venv`). Follow the steps below:

### 1. Create and activate the virtual environment

Open the terminal at the root of the project and run:
```bash
# Create the virtual environment in the “venv” folder
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install MiniLibX using venv
Open the terminal after activate venv and run this command at the root of the project:
```bash
pip install mlx-2.2-py3-none-any.whl
```
